# C++ Code Examples

This folder has C++ code examples build using `libtorch`. Learnings from here will be applied in the final code.

For now I have implemented the following:
- `dot_prod`: simple brute force dot product on two batched vectors
- `brute_force`: brute force method of matrix multiplication
- `scatter_sum_simple`: `scatter_add` from `pytorch_scatter`. This segfaults sometime though it does print the values.
